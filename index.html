            <p>Regardless of their level, a football player's kit is about confidence as much as it's about performance.
                From junior to professional, it's your amour from self-doubt. A reminder that no matter where you are in
                the journey "from grassroots to greatness," you belong there. And yet, this critical step in preparing
                the team's next season has been surprisingly traditional.</p>
            <h3>Turning Athletes into Designers</h3>
            <p>The process began with one representative from the team meeting with a retailer armed with notes from
                players and management. This customer then explains what they are looking for, pointing to samples that
                are not quite right while flipping through a pile of catalogs the retailer offers. Hopefully, one of
                them is Nike.

            <h2>Moving away from the hassle of paper catalogues</h2>
            <p>These clients had a clear idea of what they wanted but had no accurate way to capture and communicate it.
                To make matters worse, there were numerous ways their design could be misinterpreted. Teams would
                verbally describe how they wanted their kits to look and hoped that every person in the assembly chain
                would understand. Catalogue photography struggled to capture how material genuinely looked, leading to
                misaligned expectations for the final product. In the end, XX% of orders that did make it to Nike was
                returned for not matching the desired result. </p>
